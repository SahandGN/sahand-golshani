<p>
    <b>France</b>, officially the <b>French Republic</b> (French: <i>République française</i>), is a transcontinental
    country spanning Western Europe and overseas regions and territories in South America and the Atlantic, Pacific and
    Indian
    Oceans. Including all of its territories, France has twelve time zones, the most of any country. Its metropolitan
    area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the
    North
    Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic,
    the French West Indies, and several islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean.

<h3>Provinces of france:</h3>
<p>
    The provinces of France were roughly equivalent to the historic counties of England. They came into their final form
    over the course of many hundreds of years, as many dozens of semi-independent fiefs and former independent countries
    came to be incorporated into the French royal domain. Because of the manner in which the provinces evolved, each had
    its own sets of feudal traditions, laws, taxation systems and courts; the system represented an impediment to
    effective administration of the entire country from Paris. During the early years of the French Revolution, in an
    attempt to centralise the administration of the whole country and to remove the influence of the French nobility
    over the country, the entirety of the province system was abolished and replaced by the system of departments in use
    today.
