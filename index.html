        <b>France</b>, officially the <b>French Republic</b> (French: <i>République française</i>), is a
        transcontinental
        country spanning Western Europe and overseas regions and territories in South America and the Atlantic, Pacific
        and
        Indian
        Oceans. Including all of its territories, France has twelve time zones, the most of any country. Its
        metropolitan
        area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the
        North
        Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North
        Atlantic,
        the French West Indies, and several islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean.

    <p id="france_provinces">
        The provinces of France were roughly equivalent to the historic counties of England. They came into their final
        form
        over the course of many hundreds of years, as many dozens of semi-independent fiefs and former independent
        countries
        came to be incorporated into the French royal domain. Because of the manner in which the provinces evolved, each
        had
        its own sets of feudal traditions, laws, taxation systems and courts; the system represented an impediment to
        effective administration of the entire country from Paris. During the early years of the French Revolution, in
        an
        attempt to centralise the administration of the whole country and to remove the influence of the French nobility
        over the country, the entirety of the province system was abolished and replaced by the system of departments in
        use
        today.

            <h4>Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century)</h4>
            <p>At the end of the Antiquity period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a
                remaining
                Gallo-Roman territory, known as the Kingdom of Syagrius. Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the
                Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled the western part of Armorica. As a result, the Armorican
                peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this
                region.

            <p>
                The first leader to make himself king of all the Franks was Clovis I, who began his reign in 481,
                routing
                the last forces of the Roman governors of the province in 486. Clovis claimed that he would be baptized
                a
                Christian in the event of his victory against the Visigoths, which was said to have guaranteed the
                battle.
                Clovis regained the southwest from the Visigoths, was baptized in 508, and made himself master of what
                is
                now western Germany.
                Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic
                Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title "Eldest daughter of the Church"
                (French:
                La fille aînée de l'Église) by the papacy,[46] and French kings would be called "the Most Christian
                Kings of
                France" (Rex Christianissimus).</p>

            <h4>Revolutionary France (1789–1799)</h4>
            <img src="images/Revolutionary%20France_1.jpg">
            <p>Facing financial troubles, King Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General (gathering the three Estates of
                the
                realm) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives
                of
                the Third Estate formed into a National Assembly, signalling the outbreak of the French Revolution.
                Fearing
                that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents stormed the Bastille on 14
                July
                1789, a date which would become France's National Day.
            </p>

            <p>
                In early August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as
                personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights. Through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the
                Citizen (27 August 1789) France established fundamental rights for men. The Declaration affirms "the
                natural
                and imprescriptible rights of man" to "liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression".
                Freedom of
                speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests were outlawed. It called for the destruction of
                aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public
                office based on talent rather than birth. In November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalise and sell
                all
                property of the Catholic Church which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a
                Civil
                Constitution of the Clergy reorganized the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the
                Church to
                levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the
                civil
                war breaking out some years later. While King Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population,
                his
                disastrous flight to Varennes (June 1791) seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political
                salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the
                abolition
                of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.</p>

            <h4>Napoleon and 19th century (1799–1914)</h4>
            <p>Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the
                French Empire (1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies
                against
                the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. His armies
                conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena-Auerstadt or
                Austerlitz. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established
                kingdoms.
            </p>
            <img src="images/Napoleon.jpg">
            <p>
                These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the
                metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. In June 1812, Napoleon
                attacked
                Russia, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian
                attacks, and finally winter. After the catastrophic Russian campaign, and the ensuing uprising of
                European
                monarchies against his rule, Napoleon was defeated and the Bourbon monarchy restored. About a million
                Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars.After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally
                defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, the monarchy was re-established (1815–1830), with new
                constitutional limitations.
